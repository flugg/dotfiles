Dotfiles for Mac using Brew, OhMyZsh, Antibody, Vim and more. Unlike a lot other dotfiles projects this has put a lot of thought into the user experience and safe usage. This will never replace your existing files and a fresh install will tell you exactly what's happening behind the scenes.

# Installation

To get started, clone the project to your home directory:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:flugger/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Then run the installation script:

```shell
sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
